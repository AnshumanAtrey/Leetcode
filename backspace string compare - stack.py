'''
Given two strings S and T, return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. # means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.

Example 1:

Input: S = "ab#c", T = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "ac".
Example 2:

Input: S = "ab##", T = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "".
Example 3:

Input: S = "a##c", T = "#a#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "c".
