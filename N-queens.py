'''
The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. For example, following is a solution for 4 Queen problem.

The expected output is a binary matrix which has 1s for the blocks where queens are placed. For example, following is the output matrix for above 4 queen solution.

{ 0,  1,  0,  0}
{ 0,  0,  0,  1}
{ 1,  0,  0,  0}
{ 0,  0,  1,  0}
